			<h1>al waseet</h1>
			<p>al waseet is a SaaS solution for restaurants, bars, F&B venues & hospitality groups. Its QR Ordering application is a customizable solution for restaurants. It increases turnover of visitors, shortens ordering time and allows waiters to focus on delivering food.</p>
			<p>The whole product was built using MERN-stack and an in-house design system. I coded every application myself and designed every page almost by myself (my business partners took part in the design sessions).</p>
			<p>Even though this start-up did not take off, I am still immensely proud of the work we have done. Take a look at the code, the designs and the demo using the links below:</p>

			<h1>Reflexx</h1>
			<p>Reflexx is a startup that was building training devices for athletes to train their reaction time and to improve their concentration (this logo, by the way, is the only item that was not done by me).</p>
			<p>Although, not often talked about, it's a project I've enjoyed doing and I am very happy that I finished the MVP anyway.</p>

			<h1 class=" Text_Align_Center">Sensors-equipped Bed for Sleep Apnea Diagnosis</h1>
			<p>Well, while it would be easier to copy-paste an abstract here, I would prefer writing about this project in a more informal style. This was my senior university project, for which I received an A. As the title suggests, it's a bed, or more specifically a mattress filled with sensors and microcontrollers that read bodyâ€™s physiological data. It is then analyzed to determine whether the user has sleep apnea.</p>
			<p>There were two primary challenges. One was to calibrate the sensors and enable a continuous stream of uninterrupted data. The other was to make mattress at least semi-comfortable and presentable. Luckily, both were handled well.</p>
