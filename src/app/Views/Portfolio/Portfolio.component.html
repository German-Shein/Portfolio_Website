			<p class="Portfolio_Exhibit_Description_Paragraph">Well, while it would be easier to copy-paste an abstract here, I would prefer writing about this project in a more informal style. This was my senior university project, for which I received an A. As the title suggests, it's a bed, or more specifically a mattress filled with sensors and microcontrollers that read bodyâ€™s physiological data. It is then analyzed to determine whether the user has sleep apnea.</p>
			<p class="Portfolio_Exhibit_Description_Paragraph">There were two primary challenges. One was to calibrate the sensors and enable a continuous stream of uninterrupted data. The other was to make mattress at least semi-comfortable and presentable. Luckily, both were handled well.</p>
